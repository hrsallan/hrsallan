## 🦾  About Me

My name is Allan Silva, and I am a Computer Science student at UNIPAC Barbacena. My journey into technology is unconventional; I discovered my passion for programming after years of dedicated study toward a military career. This new path was solidified when I won my university's Programming Marathon in my very first semester—a rare achievement that confirmed I was exactly where I needed to be.

Driven by the discipline and problem-solving mindset developed during my earlier studies, I am now focused on mastering languages like C, Python, and Java. I am currently developing the VigilaCore project, applying my expertise in automation and data analysis to solve real-world operational challenges. My goal is to continuously evolve as a developer and pursue international scholarship opportunities to further my studies in Information Technology.
